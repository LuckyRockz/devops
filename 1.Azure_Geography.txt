    - Regions 
	     - Logical part of global infra. Every region comprise of muiltiple availability zones.  
		 
	- Zones 
	     - Each Availability zone = collection of miultple data centers with reduant power, netwokr 100mts - 1000 mts distance. 
		
	- Availability set
	      - in the same availability zone , azure vm will be provisioned in multiple physical vms. 
		  - if vm is down for any reason , then from anathor physical server through availability set it will be up and running. 
		  
	- Regional Pairs. 
	       - if one region goes down , then azure servicew will come up from anathor region thtough region pair. (Azure configures it as unidirecorional and bidirectorional) 
		   - where areregion pairs.
